# MikesBlueTheme
## A Blue Theme for FreeCAD Version 1.0 and Version 1.1

## Background
By default, FreeCAD ships with three themes.  
FreeCAD Light - a bacic light theme.  
FreeCAD Dark - a basic dark theme.  
and FreeCAD Classic which uses the Local Operating System Fonts and Colours.  
Settings for the internal UI inside FreeCAD can be modified by the user but custom changes to menus and layouts are more complex thus requiring a dedicated system theme.

## Reason for this Theme
I'm not a great fan of dark themes so I was using the FreeCAD Classic Theme which has the look and feel of my operating system.  
Ever since the early days of Windows 95/98 and XP etc, blue has been a dominant colour so I decided to make my own FreeCAD Theme using the look and feel of a classic operating system but with a modern twist.  
The result is MikesBlueTheme.  
It should work under all Operating Systems.  I use Linux - hence the Tux Icon when installed via the Addon Manager.  
This is MikesBlueTheme, I hope you like it.

## Colours
FreeCAD's Light and Dark Themes incorporate appropriate UI colours that best fit the dark and light background colours.  
Whilst designing MikesBlueTheme, it was clear that the default UI colours for the Sketcher wouldn't work with my selected blue background.  
So I have changed the Sketcher Colours as follows:-

Unconstrained Geometry is White  
Constrained Geometry is Dull Green  
Construction Unconstrained Geometry is Light Blue  
Construction Constrained Geometry is Lighter Blue  
External Geometry is Yellow  
Fully Constrained Sketch is Bright Green  
Invalid Sketch is Red  
Constraint Symbols are Dark Yellow  
Dimensions are Dark Yellow  
Referenced Constraints are Dark Yellow  
New Elements are Grey  

In my opinion, the above colours provide clean easy to read sketches but can be altered in the usual way using Edit Preferences - Sketcher - Appearance.

This is an example of a simple Sketch using MikesBlueTheme
